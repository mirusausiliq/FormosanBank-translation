# Formosan Languages

The **Formosan languages** belong to the Austronesian language family, one of the world's largest and most geographically widespread language groups. While the Austronesian languages extend from Madagascar in the west to Easter Island in the east, Taiwan is home to a significant number of unique languages within this family. These languages are collectively known as the Formosan languages.

## Origin and Historical Background

The Austronesian-speaking people are believed to have first settled in Taiwan around **6,000 years ago**, making it one of the earliest regions to develop distinct Austronesian languages. The diversity among the Formosan languages is a testament to this long history, as the island served as a hub of linguistic evolution and cultural exchange before the Austronesian people began migrating to other parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

## The Formosan Languages Today

Today, there are **16 officially recognized Formosan languages**, though their vitality varies greatly. Formosan languages today are spoken only by a portion of Taiwan's indigenous population, constituting ~2% of Taiwan's population. Therefore, many of these languages are considered endangered, with only a few actively spoken in daily life. The speakers often reside in specific Indigenous communities, and revitalization efforts are ongoing to ensure these languages survive for future generations.

The Formosan languages include:

- **Amis** (Ami)
- **Atayal** (Tayal)
- **Bunun**
- **Kanakanavu**
- **Kavalan**
- **Paiwan**
- **Puyuma**
- **Rukai**
- **Saaroa**
- **Saisiyat**
- **Sakizaya**
- **Seediq**
- **Thao**
- **Truku**
- **Tsou**
- **Yami/Tao** (spoken on Orchid Island)

These languages are spread across various regions in Taiwan, with some communities residing in remote mountainous areas, while others are found along the coast.

## A Legacy of Suppression and Revitalization

Throughout history, the use of Formosan languages has been suppressed under different colonial regimes. The most striking example occurred during the **Mandarin-only policy** from **1949 to 1987**, which enforced Mandarin Chinese as the sole official language, significantly impacting the transmission of Formosan languages to younger generations.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in revitalizing these languages, driven by government initiatives and grassroots efforts. This includes language education in schools, proficiency exams, immersion programs, and media broadcasting in Indigenous languages. The **Indigenous Languages Research and Development Foundation** and various local organizations play a vital role in these efforts.
