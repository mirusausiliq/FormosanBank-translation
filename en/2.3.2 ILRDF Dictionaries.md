# ILRDF Dictionaries

## Overview

The [Indigenous Languages Research and Development Foundation](https://www.ilrdf.org.tw/en/) (ILRDF) dictionaries are a comprehensive digital resource designed to preserve and promote Taiwan’s indigenous languages. Built upon the foundational [writing systems](https://yongfu.name/temp-data/pdf/writingsystemsdoc.pdf) announced in 2005 by the [Council of Indigenous Peoples](https://www.cip.gov.tw/en/index.html) and the Ministry of Education, these dictionaries represent the culmination of nearly seven years of collaborative effort involving hundreds of participants. The ILRDF dictionaries serve as an essential tool for language revitalization, education, and research, ensuring the cultural and linguistic heritage of Taiwan's indigenous peoples is preserved for future generations.

The **ILRDF Dictionaries Corpus** is an integral part of the FormosanBank project, providing a rich and structured dataset of the 16 officially recognized Formosan languages: **Amis, Atayal, Saisiyat, Thao, Seediq, Bunun, Paiwan, Rukai, Truku, Kavalan, Tsou, Kanakanavu, Saaroa, Puyuma, Yami,** and **Sakizaya**. These dictionaries are invaluable for documenting and preserving linguistic diversity. They include text, audio recordings, and translations, making them a comprehensive resource for research, education, and language revitalization.

## Background

The project began in 2007 with the systematic compilation of dictionaries for the **16 indigenous languages**. Each dictionary took two years to complete, involving the dedication of language teachers, experts, and scholars. By 2014, all dictionaries had been completed, marking a significant milestone in the documentation of Taiwan's indigenous languages.

Recognizing the importance of sustainability, the ILRDF digitized these dictionaries and launched the **Indigenous Languages Online Dictionary** platform. This digital transformation allows the dictionaries to remain dynamic, expandable, and maintainable, becoming a vital resource for language promotion, teaching, research, and learning.

## Processing the ILRDF Corpus

Below, we outline the processing pipeline and quality control (QC) measures that were implemented to structure the data into a machine-readable format while ensuring its accuracy and usability.

1. **Data Extraction from PDFs**
   - The process began by extracting dictionary entries from PDF files provided by the ILRDF for each language. The entries were identified using specific markers (e.g., the symbol ★) to distinguish dictionary content from other text.
   - Extracted entries were stored as word lists in the ``words_list`` directory for further processing.
2. **API Integration for Word Data**
   - The extracted words were used to query the ILRDF API, retrieving:
     - **Definitions** of the words.
     - **Example sentences** demonstrating their use in context.
     - **Audio links** for pronunciation.
   - The results of these API calls were saved in ``.PickleScrapes`` for each language, enabling streamlined access and reuse.
3. **XML Conversion**
   - The scraped data was structured into XML format following the FormosanBank XML standard, ensuring compatibility with other corpora in FormosanBank.
   - Each dictionary entry was represented as an XML ``<S>`` element, containing:
     - ``<FORM>``: The original word or phrase.
     - ``<TRANSL>``: Chinese translations of the word or examples.
     - ``<AUDIO>``: Links to or paths for audio files.
4. **Audio Download and Integration**
   - Audio files were downloaded using the API links and stored in language-specific subfolders under ``XML/audio``.
   - The corresponding XML files were updated to include local paths to the audio files for seamless integration.
5. **Cleaning and Standardization**
   - XML files underwent further cleaning to remove empty elements and standardize punctuation and orthography.
   - HTML escape codes were replaced with the corresponding characters, and a ``kindOf="standard"`` attribute was added to ``<FORM>`` elements. The original text would be ``<FORM kindOf="original">`` and any text that will be standardized from this point will be in ``<FORM kindOf="standard">``
6. **Quality Control**
   - Several QC steps were performed, including:
     - **Cross-referencing word lists and API results** to ensure all entries were successfully processed.
     - **Validation of XML structure** to confirm compliance with the FormosanBank schema.
     - **Manual checks of random samples** to verify data integrity.
     - **Character Frequency Analysis** to spot any abnormalities in the orthography with [the official orthography](https://yongfu.name/temp-data/pdf/writingsystemsdoc.pdf) as reference.
