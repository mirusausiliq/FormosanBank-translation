# Newsletters

Welcome to the FormosanBank Newsletters page! Here, we document the process we are going through to document Formosan languages via our newsletters. These newsletters are your window into our latest discoveries, project milestones, and the innovative methods we’re employing to collect, process, and share the data that powers FormosanBank.

Each newsletter offers a closer look at our work, from updates on corpus expansions to new features, tools, and resources we’re developing to support language research and revitalization efforts. Explore our subpages to dive into individual newsletters, where you’ll find in-depth articles, progress reports, and insights into the evolving world of FormosanBank.

## September 2023

Welcome to the Septemper 2023 edition of the FormosanBank newsletter! Here, we recap key achievements from the first months of our project, as we laid the groundwork for creating a machine-readable corpus of the Indigenous Formosan languages.

1. **Securing Funding**
   We are thrilled to announce a 3-year grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation, which enables us to hire staff and conduct essential research trips. This support will accelerate our efforts to build and expand the FormosanBank corpus.
2. **Resource Assessment**
   Our team has cataloged existing resources and obtained permissions for essential materials, including dictionaries, corpora, and audio recordings. This step has brought us closer to compiling the largest machine-readable collection of endangered languages.
3. **Example Sentence Extraction**
   We extracted thousands of example sentences from 16 electronic dictionaries, creating a valuable parallel corpus for future machine learning applications. This work forms a strong foundation for our ongoing data processing and analysis efforts.

## October 2024

Welcome to the October 2024 edition of the FormosanBank newsletter! We’ve made significant strides in our mission to preserve and revitalize the Indigenous Formosan languages. The FormosanBank project officially began September 1, 2023, and here’s a quick summary of our latest developments:

1. **Project Progress**
   We’re excited to report that the FormosanBank corpus now contains over 6 million words and 360 hours of audio, covering a wide range of linguistic data. We’re in the final stages of quality control and are preparing for the first official release.
2. **Advances in Machine Translation**
   Our initial machine translation efforts between English, Amis, and Paiwan languages have yielded promising results. BLEU scores indicate usable translations, and we're working on acquiring more training materials to improve accuracy further.
3. **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**
   ASR technology continues to progress, with preliminary models achieving an error rate of under 50% for several languages, a notable milestone in endangered language transcription. We’re working with additional data to refine and enhance these results.
4. **Historical Resource Digitization**
   We’ve made strides in digitizing historical records, including OCR adaptations for Siraya. These efforts are part of our mission to make archival materials accessible for both research and education.
5. **Computational Linguistics Research**
   We’ve started computational studies on sentence structures and grammatical voice systems across Formosan languages, with initial findings expected soon.
