# FormosanBank

FormosanBank serves as a **centralized repository** for linguistic data across the 16 extant Formosan languages. The project aims to make these resources easily accessible for **researchers**, **educators**, and **indigenous community members** to facilitate research, education, and language preservation efforts. The materials in the corpus include:

- **Texts and Transcriptions**: Digitized texts, transcribed audio, dictionaries, and reference grammars.
- **Audio Recordings**: A range of spoken language materials, such as Indigenous news, talk shows, traditional stories, and interviews, covering diverse dialects and speaker demographics.
- **Annotated Corpora**: Detailed linguistic annotations including word-level glosses, morpheme-level segmentation, phonological transcriptions, and translations in multiple languages.

Data collection is ongoing and encompasses a wide array of sources, such as **dictionaries, historical documents, Indigenous media**, and **academic publications**. The corpora currently being processed include materials like **Amis and Paiwan YouTube videos, Indigenous talk shows, eBooks**, and **academic texts** (see the current list of corpora [here](https://ai4commsci.gitbook.io/formosanbank/the-bank-architecture/corpora)).

## Standardized Format

FormosanBank uses a **standardized XML format** developed by the **Pangloss Collection** to ensure consistency across the corpus. This format organizes data hierarchically, representing **texts, sentences, words**, and **morphemes**, with each level annotated as needed. The structure allows for optional elements like **translations** and **audio references**, making the data suitable for both linguistic analysis and computational processing.

The format includes attributes for essential metadata, such as **citations, copyright information**, and **language codes**, ensuring transparency and proper attribution. By adopting a consistent format, FormosanBank facilitates **data sharing, analysis**, and **integration with other linguistic tools**.

## Copyright and Licensing

Each resource in FormosanBank has its own **copyright and licensing terms**, with most materials made available under **Creative Commons licenses** to encourage reuse and sharing. Licensing details, including copyright holders and usage restrictions, are provided on the individual resource pages. This ensures transparency and respect for **intellectual property rights** while making the data as accessible as possible.

## Structure and Accessibility

FormosanBank’s resources are organized to support **both linguistic analysis and community use**. The data is structured with:

- **Metadata for easy search and retrieval**, including language, dialect, speaker information, and source details.
- **APIs and downloadable datasets** to facilitate computational research and integration with other tools.

The format's flexibility also allows researchers to **annotate data at different levels of granularity**, making FormosanBank a valuable resource for projects ranging from **basic language documentation** to **advanced natural language processing**.

## Supporting Language Revitalization

FormosanBank is more than a research tool; it plays a crucial role in **revitalizing endangered Formosan languages**. By providing a well-organized and accessible collection of linguistic resources, FormosanBank supports:

- **Educational initiatives**: Creating teaching materials and learning resources for use in schools and community programs.
- **Community-driven documentation projects**: Assisting local communities in recording and preserving their languages.
- **Digital tool development**: Enabling the creation of language technologies like **speech recognition, machine translation**, and **language learning apps**.

## Looking Ahead

The project is continually evolving, with plans to **expand the corpus, improve data quality**, and **incorporate new technologies** for linguistic research. Collaboration with **Indigenous communities, linguists, and technology experts** remains a key component of FormosanBank’s growth, ensuring that the project remains **community-oriented** and **culturally sensitive**.
