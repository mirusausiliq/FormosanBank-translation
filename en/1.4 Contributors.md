# Contributors

We are deeply indebted to the many individuals and organizations who have supported the Formosan Bank project. This initiative would not have been possible without their dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to preserving the rich linguistic heritage of the Formosan languages.

We are immensely grateful to the [Indigenous Languages Research and Development Foundation (ILRDF)](https://www.ilrdf.org.tw/), based in Taipei, Taiwan, for their invaluable contribution. ILRDF has generously shared their extensive data on Formosan languages with us, enabling our team to push forward in creating a comprehensive, machine-readable corpus. We owe much of our progress to their partnership.
