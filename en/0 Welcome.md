# Welcome

Welcome to FormosanBank, a large-scale data-driven project dedicated to the preservation and revitalization of the Indigenous Formosan languages of Taiwan. These languages, which form a significant part of the Austronesian language family, are endangered, with some facing the risk of extinction. Our mission is to create a comprehensive, machine-readable corpus of these languages to support linguistic research, language education, and revitalization efforts.

Here, you'll find a description of the corpus collected and processed across the 16 official Formosan languages, which includes over 8 million tokens and over 730 hours of audio across the languages (detailed breakdown can be found [here](https://ai4commsci.gitbook.io/formosanbank/the-bank-architecture/corpora)). You'd further find a detailed description of how the data is structured and the various way to access it. You can also access the github with all the work and data related to FormosanBank [here](https://github.com/FormosanBank/FormosanBank) and the huggingFace organization with all the audio files from [here](https://huggingface.co/FormosanBank).

The large-scale nature of FormosanBank would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of numerous individuals and organizations.
