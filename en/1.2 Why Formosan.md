# Why Formosan?

The **Formosan languages** offer a rare and valuable opportunity to explore some of the most **diverse and linguistically unique** languages within the **Austronesian language family**. Unlike other Austronesian languages that are more closely related to one another, Formosan languages stand apart due to their distinct evolutionary paths, making them crucial to understanding the origins and diversification of this language family.

## Breaking the Mold: Challenging Linguistic Theories

A significant reason to study Formosan languages lies in their **ability to challenge and potentially reshape established linguistic theories**. Much of the research in modern linguistics has been disproportionately based on a small set of languages, predominantly **Indo-European** languages like English, French, and German. These languages share structural similarities that have heavily influenced the development of linguistic theories on **syntax, morphology, and phonology**.

In contrast, **Formosan languages exhibit features** that are rarely found in languages upon which traditional linguistic theories are built. For example:

- **omplex Voice Systems**: Formosan languages employ an intricate voice system where the subject’s role can shift based on verbal affixes. The system does not conform to the typical active/passive alternation seen in many European languages. Instead, it includes multiple voice forms (e.g., agent, patient, instrumental, and benefactive), often referred to as a "symmetric voice system." This structure defies simple categorization and challenges the notion that active/passive distinctions are universal or optimal for all languages.
- **Verb-Initial and Flexible Word Order**: Many Formosan languages are **verb-initial**, and some even exhibit **object-before-subject** orders. These configurations are uncommon in the world’s languages, making Formosan languages valuable for testing claims about **cognitive biases in word order preference and processing efficiency** in language.
- **Extensive Use of Reduplication**: The use of reduplication in Formosan languages goes beyond simple pluralization or emphasis; it can indicate **aspectual distinctions, intensification, or even noun derivation**. This complexity challenges common theories about **morphological simplicity** and productivity.

These unique features make Formosan languages a **testing ground for linguistic theory**, with the potential to **break or refine** existing frameworks and broaden our understanding of what is possible in human language. The diversity of their structures opens up new avenues for exploring fundamental questions in **syntactic theory, language processing, and acquisition**.

## An Abundance of Latent Resources

Despite the endangered status of many Formosan languages, Taiwan has an impressive **array of linguistic resources** that facilitate the study of these languages due to a lot of efforts for preservation of these languages:

- **Standardized Written Forms**: All 16 extant languages have standardized orthographies, making the documentation process more systematic.
- **Reference Grammars and Dictionaries**: Many languages are supported by well-developed grammars and dictionaries, providing essential tools for linguistic research.
- **Proficiency Exams**: The existence of government-backed proficiency exams for Formosan languages shows a significant commitment to language preservation and education.
- **Rich Data Sources**: The "latent" corpus of Formosan languages includes **already-acquired materials, historical documents**, and **published corpora**. Ongoing data collection efforts continue to enrich this body of resources.

## Taiwan: A Conducive Research Environment

Taiwan's infrastructure and supportive language policies provide a **fertile environment for linguistic research**. The country boasts:

- **Excellent transportation and communication networks**, making collaboration and fieldwork more manageable.
- **Public signage in English** and the availability of language education programs, including **immersion schools** and **heritage language programs**.
- A **well-developed intellectual infrastructure**, including **active collaborations with organizations like the Indigenous Languages Research and Development Foundation**, which helps drive language revitalization efforts.

## A Rich Linguistic Landscape

The **linguistic diversity** within the Formosan languages themselves adds another layer of significance. Each language displays unique **phonological, grammatical, and lexical characteristics**, providing a broad spectrum for comparative studies. This diversity can help linguists investigate how different grammatical structures affect **language processing**, **learning**, and **cognitive representation**. By studying these languages, researchers can develop theories that are more **inclusive of non-European language structures**, leading to **new insights** into the full range of human linguistic capabilities.

## Cultural and Social Impact

Beyond academic interest, documenting and revitalizing Formosan languages has profound **cultural and social significance**. By preserving these languages, we support the **cultural identity** of Taiwan’s Indigenous communities and ensure that their linguistic heritage is not lost to history. A comprehensive body of resources can aid educational efforts, allowing these communities to **reclaim and teach their languages** to younger generations, strengthening the connection between language and cultural pride.
